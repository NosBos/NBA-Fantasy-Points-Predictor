# NBA-Fantasy-Points-Predictor

This is a project which was done at Carleton Hackathon 2019 by 3 first year Software Engineering Students.

We were all in a NBA fantasy league and were running into an issue about how to draft and select the right players.
Depending on your league rules, different players can be better than others.

For example:
League A may offer 1 Fantasy point for every steal one of your players gets.
League B may offer 3 Fantasy points for every steal one of your players gets.

A player which has a high average of steals per game will offer more benefit is League B over League A.

These varying amounts of points per statistic can make it difficult to use existing ranking systems for who is the best fantasy player.
This is where our program comes in handy.

Our code utlilizes an excel sheet which contains all of the statistics of every single NBA player during the 2018 NBA season.
It then offers GUI interface where you can enter your league specific amount of Fantasy points per statistic.

Using the personalized fantasy points given by the user and the large amount of data of the 2018 season, the program returns an excel sheet which list the players best to worst.
With this personalized ordered list, you can ensure that you are drafting the best players for your particular NBA fantasy league
